Ordered List

2. two
	3. 2.1

Or mix things up:

### Code!!!!
`this is an inline code`


```
this is whole bunch of code
```

Or you can be language specific (this is not working in my editor

```python
def print():
	print "this is python"
```

### Tables
This is annoy:

use this: <http://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables>

| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |

### Quotes
> Just like this, easy

> This is 
> actually on the same line,
> just seem to be very long

### Simply adding HTML
<ul class="social">
    <li>Just an usual unordered list, except in <a href="google.com">html</a></li>          
</ul>

### Footnotes
I have more [^1] to say up here.

[^1]: this is the footnote.


Some other features that may not be present in all cases depending on what CSS you are using.

### Abbreviation
Markdown converts text to HTML.

*[HTML]: HyperText Markup Language
